I’ve built 2 PCs for myself and I have helped a few friends and family members make their own PCs so I’m pretty passionate about builder PCs and have a pretty good amount of experience with it, especially with AMD PCs. I have a good amount of experience with front end development and with the backend I have used MongoDB before, it has been a few years, but it should come back to me quickly.

Businesswise, I feel like PCPartPicker is a little close to this idea, but it is definitely lacking in helping users to know what PC parts to pick outside of them just being compatible. Being able to know which parts are useful for what you want to do would be a great help to people first starting out with building PCs.

I don’t really have much comment on the legal side of this, but everything you put in the github README makes sense to me.
