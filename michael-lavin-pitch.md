Hi there Peyton,

I would really like to be apart of your team for the computer-builder project. I have been looking into how to build my own gaming PC lately. However, I have little knowledge about PC parts and what is a “good value”. Therefore, I think this project is a good idea, I think it would be especially useful for people like me who are trying to enter this market without much knowledge of PC hardware.

I have some experience working with databases on previous projects, using SQLite and mongoDB. However, I am certainly open to learning a new database technology. I have a LOT of experience with programing in Java and in HTML and HTML frameworks. Given that those will be the technologies used in this project, I think I would be an excellent addition to your team.

I do not have too much to say about Business and Legal other than I think those are all good ways to do this project.
