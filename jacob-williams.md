Repository: computer-builder

I actually really like the idea of a computer builder. Being able to search for parts based on the specs that we want would be 
super nice (yes, I know that PCPartPicker exists). It would be interesting to work on setting up a system that would allow users to
easily search computer parts. I am pretty familiar with the Java backend aspect of this project and feel that I would be super helpful there
In addtion, I have experience with connecting frontend aspects into backend services through the MVP pattern.

As far as business is concerned, this would be a great service to help users find parts and provide business for those who this service is
connected to. Leagally, I see no issue with this project, the only thing that might be an issue is competing with PCPartPicker, but I feel
that there are a lot of other services like it. I think the technical proposal would work just fine for this project.
