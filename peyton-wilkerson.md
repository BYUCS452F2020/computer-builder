This project sounds like a lot of fun. I've never built a PC, but I've always been interested in it. Several of my friends have built PCs. The only thing that's really stopped me is that having a laptop makes more sense for a college student (going back and forth between campus and whatnot). I plan on building a PC after I graduate though. That being said, I have looked into it a little bit and have a basic understanding of PC components.

I am familiar with java backend and feel like that's where I'd best be able to help. I'm also familiar with SQLite.


Business

Sounds great!

Legal

Yeah, I don't see any legal issues.

Technical

Backend with Java and frontend being web sounds good.


P.S.
An idea for group composition. Frontend coder, backend coder (connecting to database and stuff), and middle man coder (help connect the two)
