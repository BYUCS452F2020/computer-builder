An application that will help users in their search for the right components in their process of building their own personal computer

### Project Description

The goal of this project is to create a application that can help users who are wanting to put together their own personal computer. This can be as simple as a business computer to a heavy gaming PC.

Doing your own PC build is not very difficult, however; sometimes the hardest part of building your own PC is picking the right parts and still staying under budget.

Users will be able to enter in their own preferences and then be able to find components (RAM, Storage, etc.) that fit as close as possible to those preferences.

This will hopefully require only a little bit of research unless you are already knowledgable in computer components (RAM, Storage, CPU, etc.) However if you know nothing about good computer components then that's alright this will require a little bit of research.

### Team

I'm looking for one but preferably two others to join the team just in case the research may be a little heavier. Again you don't need to be knowledgable in building PCs.

### SQL

I am familiar with SQLite the most, but I am open to work with other suggestions.

### No-SQL

I haven't thought of which type of NoSQL database to lean towards. NoSQL databases I'm aware of are MongoDB and DynamoDB so either of those or other suggestions.

### Business

Our application will be a free application and if the product takes off since we are advertising computer component products the use of advertisement may be in the works from companies that would benefit from this technology.

### Legal

We will not be selling these products rather be assisting in users finding certain products, thus we would be identifying the manufacturers of products that we will present in this application and not brand them as our own.

The business will be a Utah LLC!

### Technical

Details:

All in all the technicallity of programming languages is up for discussion these are my suggestions:

* The back-end will be coded in Java
* The front-end will result in a web application whether using simple html or other languages.

Our priorities will be:

1. Discuss and decide on back-end and front-end languages and frameworks.
2. Research price and specs of computer components and categorize them into categories that users will be interested in. (cheap, fast, etc.)
3. Confirm a choice for the SQL database, discuss needed information for entities, and begin construction. The idea so far is to have three tables (Users, Builds(Computer Build), and Components).
4. Choose the No-SQL database type that will fulfill the issue of large amounts of usage (DynamoDB, MongoDB, etc.).
5. Implement the MVP.

### Finishing Note

This project really is going to take a lot of working together to solve this, thus a lot of what I have provided is subject to change and it can be simplified more if this does become too complex. I may have expressed the idea, but those who want to join need to be ready to voice their opinions and you can add your own feedback.
